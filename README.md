# BeoPlay: Bang & Olufsen Speakers and TVs in Home Assistant

This component enables integration with B&O equipment and Home Assistant. 

Installation is very simple, either using Config Flow

Or you can try to config using Configuration.yaml

beoplay:
    host: 192.168.xx.xx

Currently this is heavily under development so YMMV
